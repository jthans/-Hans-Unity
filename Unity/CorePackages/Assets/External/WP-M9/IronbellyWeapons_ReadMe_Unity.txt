Thank you for your purchase, hopefully you find some great use for your new weapon(s)!  If you have any questions or need any customization done, please feel free to reach out to us at support@ironbellystudios.com or check out our support thread here:  http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/aaa-quality-fps-pistol-asset-pack-from-ironbelly-studios.362469/

OPEN PACKAGE
Open the .unitypackage file in Unity.  You should have version 5.1.2 or higher installed.

Alloy-ONLY MATERIALS
There are two materials in this pack that require the Alloy Shader:
/Meshes/Materials/FPArms_Male1_DIF_ALLOYONLY
/Meshes/Materials/M9_COL_ALLOYONLY

For all users that do not have Alloy installed these materials will appear a bright magenta and show Hidden/InternalErrorShader in the Inspector window.  In order to make use of these materials you need to purchase and install the Alloy Physical Shader Framework by heading over to https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/11978 and importing it into your project.  

If you do not have Alloy, worry not, we have provided standard Unity 5 PBR materials as well that can be found in the same location and are missing the _ALLOY tag on the end of the material name:
/Meshes/Materials/FPArms_Male1_DIF
/Meshes/Materials/M9_COL

These materials look awesome as well and will work perfectly with a stock Unity install.
